ServerManager provides an easy and intuitive way to manage your VPS hosting on an easy way.

This eye-candy tool is very straight-forward; and with very little clicks you can perform the same tasks that will require server administration knowledge and some high doses of patience!

This is specially useful on environments where no admin panel is provided, as some cloud VPS servers, pay-per use/hour, as Amazon EC2 (current version), Linode, Heroku... and basically all UNIX VPS.

## Features

* DNS and subdomains management.
* Email accounts management, including forwarders and catch-all.
